- Hi,<br/> My name is Hussein, I am a software engineer from Nigeria. I enjoy travelling and living a calm life. I am also an open-source enthusiast and contributor. I'm learning a lot from the open-source community and love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happens through open-source.
 <br/> - I work mostly with Reactjs, Vuejs, Vuex and Redux. I have a humble building experience with Vuejs and Reactjs. I have worked on amazing projects and can work in a cross-functional team. I am well versed in web development tools like HTLM, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, NodeJS and MongoDB. Github serves as a host for the professional projects I've worked on as well as fun projects I handle in order to master new concepts and frameworks.<br/>
- ️ I’m looking to collaborate on more open-source projects in the community.
<br/>
- I can be reached on social media using the handles above or feel free to shoot me a mail yusufhuszy@gmail.com
